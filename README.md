myriad
======

CUDA-compatible biophysical neuronal/network simulator for computational neuroscience.

Myriad is in active development at an early alpha stage.  We are not yet prepared to support external users, but feel free to look around.  Watch this space for updates.  Some more information is available at http://cplab.net/myriad.  Important queries to Thomas Cleland at tac29@cornell.edu.
